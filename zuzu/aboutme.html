            I’m Zoe Krähenbühl, 18 years old, from a small village in Switzerland. I am currently studying at the Fachklasse Grafik in Lucerne in my fifth semester, while also completing my vocational baccalaureate.
            In my work, I am especially drawn to the connection between analog and digital processes. I enjoy exploring how textures, hand-crafted elements, and experimental materials can merge with digital tools to create visual worlds that feel both tactile and contemporary. This shapes many of my projects, from visual identities to typography and conceptual image series.
            I also have a strong passion for photography. I use the camera to capture structures, moods, and small details that often find their way into my graphic work.
            Looking ahead, I want to deepen my ability to combine these methods and continue exploring how design can surprise, question, and evoke curiosity.
